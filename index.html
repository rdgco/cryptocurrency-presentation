						<h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
						A blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions that is publicly verifiable and historically unchangeable.
					</section>

					<section>
						Ledger
						<ul>
							<li>A ledger is a record of transactions.</li>
							<li>Transactions on a blockchain describe the change of state in the ledger.</li>
							<li>Groups of transactions are combined together by time into blocks.</li>
							<li>The amount of time for each block generation varies by network.</li>
							<li>Bitcoin blocks are generated every ten minutes</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Distributed
						<ul>
							<li>A blockchain is a publicly available set of data.</li>
							<li>A peer to peer network of nodes maintains the blockchain state.</li>
							<li>Each node has a full copy of the blockchain.</li>
							<li>The process of creating new blocks is called mining.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						How large are blockchains?
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li> Bitcoin Now: 144 Gig. </li>
							<li> Bitcoin Upper Limit: 3TB. </li>
							<li> Full mining nodes must download a copy of the whole blockchain. </li>
							<li> The size of the blockchain is a challenge for scalability. </li>

						<h3>Some underlying technologies</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Public Key Cryptography </li>
							<li> Secure Hash Based Identifiers </li>
							<li> Peer to Peer Networking</li>
							<li> Proof of Work </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Public Key Cryptography</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> An algorithm generates a public key and private key pair. </li>
							<li> The private key must be kept secret by the owner. </li>
							<li> The private and public keys are cryptographically related. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						What is public key cryptography used for?
						<ul>
							<li> The holder of the private key can digitally sign a message. </li>
							<li> The message signature can be verified with the public key. </li>
							<li> 2 parties can communicate with each other and be assured that the sender holds the private key.</li>
							<li> Control and security of the private key is critical. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						Public Key Cryptography and the Bitcoin Blockchain
						<ul>
							<li> Blockchain addresses are based on the public key.</li>
							<li> The holder of a private key can issue transactions from the associated Blockchain address.</li>
							<li> A transaction can be issued to a bitcoin address with the sender's private key and the receiver's bitcoin address. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Encryption and Cryptography</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> A third party can encrypt a message with the receiver's public key. </li>
							<li> The holder of the private key can decrypt messages that were encrypted with the private key.</li>
							<li> Combined with signing, two parties can communicate with each other confidently and securely without any eavesdropping unless a third party has the privarte key</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Secure Hash Based Identifiers</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Input: Any data of any length.</li>
							<li> Output: A Fixed size alphanumeric string.</li>
							<li> Example Output: 2b12fcf1b09288fcaff797d71e </li>
							<li> Calculating a hash value for data is computationally easy.</li>
							<li> It is computationally difficult to generate original text from a hash.</li>
							<li> It is very unlikely that two different inputs yield the same hash.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> Example Uses of Hash Functions </h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Password authentication </li>
							<li> The best practice method for authenticating is to never save the password on the server. Only store a hash of the password.</li>
							<li> Source Code Versioning </li>
							<li> In git, a cryptographic hash is used to identify the entire state of all files within a version of blockchain node software</li>
							<li> Blockchains </li>
							<li> Hash functions are used to uniquely identify transactions, blocks, and the entire blockchain sequence. </li>
							<li> Each block has a final hash key that is dependent upon all transactions in that block, as well as all blocks that have been mined previously </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Peer to Peer Networks
						<ul>
							<li> A network of nodes which follow a protocol to communicate with each other. </li>
							<li> Unlike client/server with two tiers. </li>
							<li> Bittorrent is a peer to peer network for sharing files. </li>
							<li> Blockchain mining is done on peer to peer networks. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

						<section>
							Proof of Work
							<ul>
								<li> A mathematical problem that is difficult to solve. </li>
								<li> The solution to the problem is easy to validate. </li>
								<li> A node proves that it performed work by solving the problem. </li>
								<li> The network reaches consensus as other nodes validate the solution.</li>
							</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
							Bitcoin Proof of work
							<ul>
								<li> A mining node generates a hash code for the block of transactions. </li>
								<li> The hash code must start with a number of leading zeros. </li>
								<li> The node can generate different hash codes by changing one value in the transaction called the Nonce. </li>
								<li> The node will continue to make attempts until it generates a matching hash. </li>
								<li> The first node to find the matching hash wins the mining award. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
							Increasing the difficulty in Bitcoin Over Time
							<ul>
								<li> Periodically, the number of required leading zeros is increased. </li>
							</ul>
						</section>

						<section>
							Proof of work uses a lot of energy globally as each node tries to mine each subsequent block.
						</section>

						<section>
							Proof of Stake is an alternative mechanism that determines the miner for each block based on the percentage
							of currency assigned to an account for the miner.

							This saves energy by limiting the number of nodes that will attempt to mine the next block, and the mathematical
							problem no longer needs to be difficult to solve. It could possibly be as simple as creating the correct hash.
						</section>

						<h3>Distributed Open Source Software Development</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Open source software is developed by individuals and companies which collaborate globally. </li>
							<li> Open source licenses allow others to use and modify code without paying money. </li>
							<li> Sites such as github.com are the 'coding networking' hub for open source development. </li>
							<li> The software for running each type of node is developed in a collaborative environment. </li>
							<li> Nodes for the same blockchain can and are implemented in different languages </li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Ethereum Blockchain</h3>
						<ul>
							<li> Invented by Vitalik Buterin 2013. </li>
							<li> Age 23 today. </li>
						  <li>Ethereum implements smart contracts in the blockchain.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li> A smart contract is a computer program that runs on a virtual machine in the blockchain. </li>
							<li> A virtual machine is a computer that is implemented in software by each node. </li>
							<li> The blockchain contains both the computer program, and the state that it generates when transactions are executed. </li>
							<li> Public functions can be invoked in a smart contract by other smart contracts. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
						<ul>
							<li> Initial Coin Offerings are simply smart contracts that keep track of how many coins there are and what accounts they belong to. </li>
							<li> Security holes and careless programming in smart contracts has led to losses of close to a hundred million dollars of virtual currency. </li>
							<li> The SEC has declared that ICO's are illegal in the United States unless they are licensed securities. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<section>
							Distributed Apps - Dapps
						</sections>
						<section>
							<ul>
								<li> An integration between the web browser, smart contracts, and blockchains via peer to peer protocols. </li>
								<li> Ethereum allows contracts to be invoked from the web browser. </li>
								<li> CryptoKitties is now the most famous Dapp. </li>
								<li> The contract allows people to buy and breed digital cats. </li>
								<li> Its popularity has slowed transaction processing on Ethereum. </li>
